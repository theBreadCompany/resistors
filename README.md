# resistors
A small app to work with resistor color codes.

## Disclamer
This is my first UIKit and first ObjC application, the code and storyboard quality suffers respectivly. However if you have any ideas for improvements or new calculations, please open an issue.

## Usage 
Simply clone this repo and build in Xcode or with ```xcodebuild```.

## TODO
